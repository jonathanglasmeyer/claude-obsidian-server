## Implementation Priority
*When MVP is complete and deployed*

**Priority 1: Content Processing**
- Start with URL extraction and image analysis
- High user value, leverages Claude's multimodal capabilities

**Priority 2: Advanced Commands**
- Slash commands improve UX significantly
- Relatively easy to implement

**Priority 3: Analytics**
- Important for optimization but not user-facing
- Implement after usage patterns are established

**Priority 4: Enhanced Integration**
- Advanced features for power users
- Implement based on actual usage needs
